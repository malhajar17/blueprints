# Fine-tune on Domain Specific Data and Deploy Endpoint on FlexAI

This experiment demonstrates how to use FlexAI to fine-tune language models on domain-specific data using LlamaFactory, then deploy them as production-ready inference endpoints. For illustration purposes, we'll fine-tune for maximum command of French using the `Qwen2.5-7B` model and the `openhermes-fr` dataset.

You will see that this process requires configuring LlamaFactory's dataset registry, setting up training parameters, leveraging FlexAI's managed training infrastructure, and deploying the fine-tuned model as a scalable inference endpoint.

> **Note**: If you haven't already connected FlexAI to GitHub, run `flexai code-registry connect` to set up a code registry connection. This allows FlexAI to pull repositories directly using the repository URL in training commands.

## Step 1: Verify Dataset Configuration

First, ensure your domain-specific dataset is properly configured in LlamaFactory's dataset registry. For our French language example, we'll use the `openhermes-fr` dataset.

Navigate to `experiments/code/llama-factory/data/dataset_info.json` and verify the dataset entry exists:

```json
{
    "openhermes-fr": {
        "hf_hub_url": "legmlai/openhermes-fr",
        "columns": {
            "prompt": "prompt",
            "response": "accepted_completion"
        }
    }
}
```

For your own use case, replace this with your domain-specific dataset. The `openhermes-fr` dataset is specifically designed for French language tasks and serves as an excellent example of domain specialization.

## Step 2: Configure Training Parameters

The [`qwen25-7B_sft.yaml`](../../code/llama-factory/qwen25-7B_sft.yaml) file contains the training configuration for domain-specific fine-tuning. Key settings include:

- **Model**: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B` - Excellent multilingual base model suitable for domain adaptation
- **Stage**: `sft` (Supervised Fine-Tuning) - Perfect for task-specific and domain-specific adaptation
- **Dataset**: `openhermes-fr` - Example domain-specific dataset (replace with your own)
- **Training**: Full fine-tuning with DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3 for optimal performance

## Create Secrets

To access the Qwen2.5-7B model and OpenHermes-FR dataset, you need a HuggingFace token.

Use the [`flexai secret create` command](https://docs.flex.ai/cli/commands/secret/) to store your _HuggingFace Token_ as a secret. Replace `<HF_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET_NAME>` with your desired name for the secret:

```bash
flexai secret create <HF_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET_NAME>
```

Then paste your _HuggingFace Token_ API key value.

## [Optional] Pre-fetch the Model

To speed up training and avoid downloading large models at runtime, you can pre-fetch your HuggingFace model to FlexAI storage. For example, to pre-fetch the `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B` model:

1. **Create a HuggingFace storage provider:**

    ```bash
    flexai storage create HF-STORAGE --provider huggingface --hf-token-name <HF_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET_NAME>
    ```

2. **Push the model checkpoint to your storage:**

    ```bash
    flexai checkpoint push qwen25-7b --storage-provider HF-STORAGE --source-path Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B
    ```

This pre-fetched checkpoint can then be used in your training command to reduce startup time.

## Training

For a 7B model, we recommend using **1 node (8 × H100 GPUs)** to ensure reasonable training time and avoid out-of-memory issues.

### Standard Training (without prefetch)

```bash
flexai training run domain-specific-qwen25-7b-sft \
  --accels 8 --nodes 1 \
  --repository-url https://github.com/flexaihq/blueprints \
  --env FORCE_TORCHRUN=1 \
  --secret HF_TOKEN=<HF_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET_NAME> \
  --requirements-path code/llama-factory/requirements.txt \
  -- /layers/flexai_pip-install/packages/bin/llamafactory-cli train code/llama-factory/qwen25-7B_sft.yaml
```

### Training with Model Prefetch

To take advantage of model pre-fetching performed in the [Optional: Pre-fetch the Model](#optional-pre-fetch-the-model) section, use:

```bash
flexai training run domain-specific-qwen25-7b-sft-prefetched \
  --accels 8 --nodes 1 \
  --repository-url https://github.com/flexaihq/blueprints \
  --checkpoint qwen25-7b \
  --env FORCE_TORCHRUN=1 \
  --secret HF_TOKEN=<HF_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET_NAME> \
  --requirements-path code/llama-factory/requirements.txt \
  -- /layers/flexai_pip-install/packages/bin/llamafactory-cli train code/llama-factory/qwen25-7B_sft.yaml
```

## Monitoring Training Progress

You can check the status and lifecycle events of your Training Job by running:

```bash
flexai training inspect domain-specific-qwen25-7b-sft
```

Additionally, you can view the logs of your Training Job by running:

```bash
flexai training logs domain-specific-qwen25-7b-sft
```

### Training Observability with TensorBoard

For advanced monitoring and visualization of training metrics, you can leverage TensorBoard integration. FlexAI supports TensorBoard logging for detailed insights into training progress, loss curves, and model performance.

To enable TensorBoard logging, update your YAML configuration:

```yaml
report_to: tensorboard
```

Once enabled, you can access training metrics and visualizations through the FlexAI console. For more details on observability features, see the [FlexAI TensorBoard documentation](https://docs.flex.ai/platform/tensorboard/).

## Getting Training Checkpoints

Once the Training Job completes successfully, you will be able to list all the produced checkpoints:

```bash
flexai training checkpoints domain-specific-qwen25-7b-sft
```

Look for checkpoints marked as `INFERENCE READY = true` - these are ready for serving.

## Serving the Trained Model

Deploy your trained model directly from the checkpoint using FlexAI inference. Replace `<CHECKPOINT_ID>` with the ID from an inference-ready checkpoint:

```bash
flexai -v inference serve domain-specific-endpoint --checkpoint <CHECKPOINT_ID>
```

> **Note**: GPU specification for inference endpoints is currently managed automatically by FlexAI. Future versions will allow explicit GPU count specification for inference workloads to optimize cost and performance based on your specific requirements.

You can monitor your inference endpoint status:

```bash
# List all inference endpoints
flexai inference list

# Get detailed endpoint information
flexai inference inspect domain-specific-endpoint

# Check endpoint logs
flexai inference logs domain-specific-endpoint
```

## Testing Your Domain-Specific Model

Once the endpoint is running, you can test it with domain-specific prompts. For our French language example, the model should demonstrate strong French language understanding, proper grammar and syntax, and cultural context awareness.

### Before and After Training Comparison

To illustrate the improvement from fine-tuning on French data, here's a comparison using the question: **"Qui a gagné la Coupe du monde 2018 ?"** (who won the 2018 world cup?)

**Base Model Response (Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B before training):**

```
La Coupe du monde de football 2018 a été remportée par la Russie.
```

*Issues: Incorrect answer (says Russia instead of France)_

**Fine-tuned Model Response (after training on openhermes-fr):**

```
La France a remporté la Coupe du monde de football 2018, en battant le Croatie lors de la finale disputée à Moscou le 15 juillet 2018.
```

*Improvements: Correct answer (France), excellent French grammar, accurate details, proper structure_

This example demonstrates the dramatic improvement in both factual accuracy and French language quality after domain-specific fine-tuning.

### Example API Call

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-endpoint-url/v1/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Expliquez-moi les avantages de l'\''intelligence artificielle en français:",
    "max_tokens": 200,
    "temperature": 0.7
  }'
```

Adapt the prompt and evaluation criteria to match your specific domain and use case.
